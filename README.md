# OneTab-to-Markdown
_Convert OneTab export text to a markdown list._

I keep a list of articles which I find interesting in a HackMD.io page as a checklist.
This was just a method for me to learn markdown but it became a repository that I use almost every day.
In Chrome, the OneTab extension can produce an export of links.
Often, I have a lot of tabs open with articles but I don't have time to read them.
So now, I can run OneTab to get all the tabs into a text list, then paste that list into this tool, and then paste the results right into my reading list in HackMD.io

For each tab, OneTab produces a text string in the format - `URL | Title`

In HackMD.io, I store the articles as `- [ ] [Title](URL)` - which translate to a checklist of items
